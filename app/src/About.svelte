        JungleTV is a video sharing website for the <a href="https://banano.cc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
            Banano
        </a>
        community. Banano is a feeless, instant, environment-friendly cryptocurrency that's ripe for memes.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-3">
        On JungleTV, users can earn Banano by watching YouTube videos that are added by other users to a sort of
        continuously evolving playlist - the <strong>queue</strong>. The videos play in sync for everyone, making the
        experience similar to watching TV or a livestream.

        Before participating, make sure to read the
        <a href="/guidelines" use:link>guidelines for acceptable content and behavior</a>.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-3">
        You will have to spend some Banano to
        <a href="/enqueue" use:link>enqueue media</a>. How much you must spend is determined by factors like the amount
        of people watching and the length of the queue.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-3">
        The Banano spent to enqueue each piece of content is distributed among the JungleTV spectators who our fraud
        prevention monkeys deem sufficiently ripe. Make sure to
        <a href="/rewards/address" use:link> set your address to earn rewards</a>! If you watch enough media, you'll
        eventually make enough to enqueue your own - or to recover your initial spending!
